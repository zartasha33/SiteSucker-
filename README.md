## üéâ SiteSucker Pro 5.6.2 macOS & Windows [latest 2025]

SiteSucker is an Macintosh application that automatically downloads Web sites from the Internet. It does this by asynchronously copying the site‚Äôs webpages, images, PDFs, style sheets, and other files to your local hard drive, duplicating the site‚Äôs directory structure. SiteSucker Pro is an enhanced version of SiteSucker that can download embedded videos, including embedded YouTube and Vimeo videos.

SiteSucker can be used to make local copies of Web sites. By default, SiteSucker ‚Äúlocalizes‚Äù the files it downloads, allowing you to browse a site offline, but it can also download sites without modification.
